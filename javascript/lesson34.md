Below is a simple JavaScript example that demonstrates fetching data from a web API using Promises. The example uses the `fetch` function, which returns a Promise. This Promise resolves to the response of the request made to the API. JSONPlaceholder is a free fake online REST API.

```javascript
// URL for the JSONPlaceholder API
const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1";

// Fetch data from the API
fetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    // Check if the request was successful
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    return response.json(); // Parse JSON from the response
  })
  .then((data) => {
    // Process and display the fetched data
    console.log("Fetched Data:", data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle any errors that occurred during the fetch
    console.error("Fetch Error:", error);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We make a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API for a specific post.
2. The `fetch` function returns a Promise. When the request completes, the Promise resolves with the `response` object.
3. We chain `.then()` to handle the response. The first `.then()` checks if the response is OK (status in the range 200-299). If not, it throws an error. If it's OK, it parses the JSON body of the response.
4. The second `.then()` is used to process the data that was parsed from the JSON.
5. `.catch()` is used to handle any errors that might have occurred during the fetch request or response handling.

To run this code, you can simply place it in a JavaScript file in a project that's set up to make HTTP requests (like a Node.js project) or within the `<script>` tag of an HTML file and open it in a web browser. Remember that due to the browser's Same-Origin Policy, running this code might be restricted if it's not served from the same domain as the API unless the server supports CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

The error message in your terminal selection indicates that you're trying to use the `import` statement outside a module. In Node.js, the `import` statement is only available within ES modules.

By default, Node.js treats JavaScript files as CommonJS modules. To use ES modules, you need to do one of the following:

1. Change the file extension from `.js` to `.mjs`.
2. Add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` file.

Here's an example of how to add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "your-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "node-fetch": "^2.6.1"
  }
}
```

After making these changes, you should be able to use the `import` statement in your `app.js` file.

Renaming the app.js to app.mjs is not required. Working code:

```javascript
import fetch from "node-fetch";
// URL for the JSONPlaceholder API
const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1";

// Import the fetch function
// Fetch data from the API
fetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
    } else {
      throw new Error("Something went wrong...");
    }
  })
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```
