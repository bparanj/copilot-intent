```javascript
import dns from "dns";

dns.lookup("google.com", (err, address) => {
  console.log(address);
});
```

The first line is using the `import` statement to import the `dns` module in a JavaScript file.

Here's a breakdown:

- `import`: This is a keyword in JavaScript that is used to import functions, objects or values from modules into the current script. It's part of the ES6 module system.

- `dns`: This is the name of the module you're importing. In this case, it's the built-in `dns` module provided by Node.js. The `dns` module is used for DNS (Domain Name System) lookup operations, such as resolving a hostname into an IP address.

- `from "dns"`: This specifies the module from which to import. The `dns` module is a built-in module in Node.js, so you can import it directly by its name.

So, in summary, this line of code is importing the `dns` module from Node.js into your script, allowing you to use its functions and methods for DNS lookup operations.
